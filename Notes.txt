ifconfig - Displays the current configuration for a network interface when no optional parameters are supplied.
ip â€“ Address to a network interface and or configure network interface parameters on Linux operating systems.
traceroute - Track in real-time pathway taken by a packet on an IP network from a source to destination. 
tracepath - Trace the path from the orgin to destination.
ping - Troubleshoot connectivity, reachability, nmae the resolution. 
netstat - Generates displays that show network status and protocol statostics. 
ss - Provides detailed information about network sockets and connections. 
dig - Flexible tool for interrogating DNS server names. 
nslookup - Queries internet domain name servers in two modes.
route - View and manipulate the IP routing table in Unix-like and Microsoft operating systems and also in IBM OS/2 and ReactOS.
host - Look up a variety of information available through the DNS. 
arp - Display the Ip address to MAC address mappings that a system has built so that it doesn't have to fetch the same information repeatedly, discover and display details about systems on your network. 
iwconfig - Display and change the parameters of the network interface which are specific to the wireless connection. 
hostname - Name of the computer will be displayed. 
curl - Command line tool that enables data exchange between device and a server through a terminal. 
wget - Retrieve or download files from the internet.
mtr - Combines traceroute and ping, common for testing internet speed. 
whois - Tries to reach ARPANET host internic.net where it examines a user-name database to obtain information.

Gateway - A network node used in telecommunications that connect two networks with different transmission protocals together.
DNS - Name Domain System, turns NDS into IP addresses wich allow browsers to get websites and other resources.
What is a network switch? - Forwards data packets between devices, switches send packets directly to devices rather than sending thek to networks like a router does.
What is a network router? - A network router connects two or more packet switched networks.
What are access points? - A networking device that allows wireless-capable devices to connect to a wired network.
MAC address - A unique 12-character alphanumeric attribute that is used to identify individual electronic devices on a network.
What are ports? - Virtual places within a operating system where network connets start and end. 
Types of networks (WAN,LAN,PAN,MAN,VPN):
	WAN (Wide area network) - Technology that connects your offices, data centers, cloud applications, and soud storage together.
	LAN (Local area network) - Collection of devices in one physical location. 
	PAN (Personal area network) - Connects electronic devices within a users immediate area.
	MAN (metropolitan area network) - A network that is larger then a single building local area network but is located in the a single geographic area that is smaller than a wide area network.
	VPN (Virtual private network) - Encrypted connection over the internet form a device to a network.
